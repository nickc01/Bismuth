Bismuth is a simple task tracking app where you can keep track of many different tasks that are associated with a project. The app uses the following:
- NextJS/React
- Firebase for the backend
- Vercel for hosting the frontend
- [Image-in-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-in-browser?activeTab=readme) for converting images

The app allow you to create tasks, give each of them individual goals you can check off, and assign dependencies to other tasks so you can only complete them in a certain order. It also uses a windowing system where you can resize and rearrange the tasks in whichever order you want.
